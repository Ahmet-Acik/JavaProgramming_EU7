Data very important part of Tester's work life
Data---> BackEnd (Database+API) + FrontEnd (WebBrowsers)

3 Data Structures that comes with JAVA:
	Arrays (primitive data type+non-primitive(objects))
	Collections---ArrayList, List, Set, Vector....
	Maps (non-primitive , key-value)
	
Array: 	part of the Data Structure
		fixed size
		support primitive(int,double,char...) + non-primitive(Integer, Double, Character,String)
		ordered (it has index)
		can be multi-dimensional

ArrayList: 	part of Collection, internally uses Array(keeps creating new Arrays--Slow)
			size is not fixed
			supports only non-primitive 
			ordered (it has index)
			can NOT be multi-dimensional

Wrapper Class: the need for this Wrapper class is: Collections and Maps only hold non-primitive
			second: this class come with useful methods.
			turns our primitive data types into objects 
	int ---> Integer
	double -----> Double		
			
			
			

isAnagram Method Algorithm:
1. I have two words, see if they anagram
2. takes each char, and uses it's Decimal value, so I can create an array of integers
3. I have only one int array, for the first word, I want to  add value of '1' to my array
4. For the second word, I want to delete value of '1' from the same array 
5. At the end if my int array stays empty, this means that my words are anagram				
			
Arrays Utility Class
Arrays.toString method : for printing 1D arrays
Arrays.deepToString : for printing 2D arrays
Arrays.equal : for check equality of arrays
Arrays.sort : sorting the Arrays
Arrays.binarySearch
Arrays.copyOf
