 OOP Inheritance review
 Overriding   (PIQ: What is the difference between overloading and overriding?)
 
 	Inheritance: building Is A relation between classes (Has A relation) 
 	(super / sub  --- Parent / child)
 	Sub Class: inherits variables and methods of Super class
 				Constructor of parent class is not inherited 
 				(However the sub class MUST call parent constructor)
 	Super Class: Can Not inherit anything from the Sub Class
 	
 class Person{
 name,gender,dateofBirth, eat(), drink(), sleep()  // Super Class
 }	
 
 class Student extends Person{  // Is A relation
 studentId, study()
 }
 
 class Teacher extends Person{ // Is A relation
 teacherId, teach()
 }
 
 class Cybertek{          Cybertek class Has A student, Has A teacher
 		Student student1;
 		Teacher teacher1;
 }
