Data very important part of Tester's work life
Data---> BackEnd (Database+API) + FrontEnd (WebBrowsers)

3 Data Structures that comes with JAVA:
	Arrays (primitive data type+non-primitive(objects))
	Collections---ArrayList, List, Set, Vector....
	Maps (non-primitive , key-value)
	
Array: 	part of the Data Structure
		fixed size
		support primitive(int,double,char...) + non-primitive(Integer, Double, Character,String)
		ordered (it has index)
		can be multi-dimensional

ArrayList: 	part of Collection, internally uses Array(keeps creating new Arrays--Slow)
			size is not fixed
			supports only non-primitive 
			ordered (it has index)
			can NOT be multi-dimensional

Wrapper Class: the need for this Wrapper class is: Collections and Maps only hold non-primitive
			second: this class come with useful methods.
